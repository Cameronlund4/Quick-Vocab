# Quick-Vocab
A program designed to do the busywork of vocabulary for you so you have more time to do what really matters: 
actually learning it. Quick Vocab aims to supply a medium to quickly define your vocab and related items, make
use of these definitons, and get right into studying. Quick Vocab takes in a text file which specifies what you
want to do with your terms, followed by a list of your terms. It will then process these terms and manipulate them
to your heart's desire.

#### Still very much WIP. More coming soon.
