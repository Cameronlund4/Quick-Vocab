# Quick Vocab
Quick Vocab, or QuickVoc, is a program designed to do the busywork of vocabulary for you leaving more time to do what really matters: actually learning the material. Quick Vocab aims to supply a medium to quickly define your vocab and related items, make use of these definitons, and get right into studying. Quick Vocab takes in a text file which specifies what you want to do with your terms, followed by a list of your terms. It then processes these terms and will manipulate them to your heart's desire, doing things like creating quizlets and generating a study sheet.

#### Still very much WIP. More information coming soon. 

##### Note: This tool is created with the intent of making studying for vocab easier, **_NOT_** to cheat on homework or any sort of assignment. You are responsible for how you use this tool, and any trouble to get into by using it. Please see [our license.](LICENSE.txt)
